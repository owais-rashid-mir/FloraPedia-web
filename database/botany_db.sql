The name \"buckwheat\" is used for several other species, such as Fagopyrum tataricum, a domesticated food plant raised in Asia. Despite the name, buckwheat is not related to wheat, as it is not a grass. Instead, buckwheat is related to sorrel, knotweed, and rhubarb. Buckwheat is referred to as a pseudocereal because its seeds\' culinary use is the same as cereals\', owing to their composition of complex carbohydrates.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>Etymology:</strong></span><br />The name \"buckwheat\" or \"beech wheat\" comes from its triangular seeds, which resemble the much larger seeds of the beech nut from the beech tree, and the fact that it is used like wheat. The word may be a translation of Middle Dutch boecweite: boec (Modern Dutch beuk), \"beech\" (see PIE *bhago-) and weite (Mod. Dut. tarwe, antiquated Dut. weit), wheat, or may be a native formation on the same model as the Dutch word.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>Cultivation:</strong></span><br />&nbsp;<br />Buckwheat with flowers, ripe and unripe seeds<br />Buckwheat, a short-season crop, does well on low-fertility or acidic soils, but the soil must be well drained. Too much fertilizer, especially nitrogen, reduces yields. In hot climates it can be grown only by sowing late in the season, so that it blooms in cooler weather. The presence of&nbsp;pollinators&nbsp;greatly increases the yield. The nectar from buckwheat flower makes a dark-colored honey. Buckwheat is sometimes used as a&nbsp;green manure, as a plant for&nbsp;erosion&nbsp;control, or as wildlife cover and feed.<br /><br />The plant has a branching root system with a primary&nbsp;taproot&nbsp;that reaches deeply into moist soil.[7]&nbsp;Buckwheat has triangular seeds and produces a flower that is usually white, although can also be pink or yellow.[8]&nbsp;Buckwheat branches freely, as opposed to&nbsp;tillering&nbsp;or producing suckers, causing a more complete adaption to its environment than other cereal crops.[7]&nbsp;The seed hull density is less than that of water, making the hull easy to remove.[8]<br /><br />Buckwheat is raised for grain where a short season is available, either because it is used as a second crop in the season, or because the climate is limiting. Buckwheat can be a reliable&nbsp;cover crop&nbsp;in summer to fit a small slot of warm season. It establishes quickly, which suppresses summer weeds.[9]&nbsp;Buckwheat has a growing period of only 10&ndash;12 weeks[10]&nbsp;and it can be grown in high latitude or northern areas.[11]&nbsp;It grows 75 to 125 centimetres (30 to 50 inches) tall.', '16064307675fc0302ff14b5buckwheat.jpg'),

Its high protein content allows it to complement low-quality tropical forages.&nbsp;G. sepium&nbsp;can tolerate repeated cutting, every 2 to 4 months depending on the climate. Cutting&nbsp;G. sepium&nbsp;causes it to retain its leaves during the&nbsp;dry season&nbsp;when many forage crops have lost their leaves. In some cases it is the only source of feed during the dry season.[7]<br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>Intercropping:</strong></span><br />G. sepium&nbsp;trees are used for&nbsp;intercropping&nbsp;in part because they&nbsp;fix nitrogen&nbsp;in the soil and tolerate low soil fertility, so when they are interplanted with crops they can boost crop yields significantly, without the need of chemical fertilizers.<br /><br />G. Sepium&nbsp;tolerates being cut back to crop height, and can even be&nbsp;coppiced, year after year. When the trees are cut back, they enter a temporary dormant state during which their root systems do not compete for nutrients needed by the crops, so the crops can establish themselves.[10]<br /><br />These properties also enable G.

As a Caribbean native,&nbsp;G. sepium&nbsp;has traditionally been used for live fencing in Cuba.<br /><br />As in India, during the recent past one could see many&nbsp;living fences&nbsp;around mango and cashew orchards and agricultural properties in Goa, Maharashtra and Karnataka, erected with&nbsp;G. sepium&nbsp;and tied with&nbsp;bamboo&nbsp;rafters.<br /><br />G. sepium&nbsp;is also used for its insect repellent properties. Farmers in Latin America often wash their livestock with a paste made of crushed&nbsp;G. sepium&nbsp;leaves to ward off&nbsp;torsalos&nbsp;(botflies).

Maize is also used in making&nbsp;ethanol&nbsp;and other&nbsp;biofuels.<br /><br />Maize is widely cultivated throughout the world, and a greater weight of maize is produced each year than any other grain.[6]&nbsp;In 2014, total world production was 1.04 billion&nbsp;tonnes.

Certain varieties of maize have been bred to produce many additional developed ears. These are the source of the \"baby corn\" used as a vegetable in&nbsp;Asian cuisine.<br /><br />The apex of the stem ends in the tassel, an&nbsp;inflorescence&nbsp;of male flowers. When the tassel is mature and conditions are suitably warm and dry, anthers on the tassel&nbsp;dehisce&nbsp;and release pollen. Maize pollen is&nbsp;anemophilous&nbsp;(dispersed by wind), and because of its large settling velocity, most pollen falls within a few meters of the tassel.<br /><br />Elongated&nbsp;stigmas, called&nbsp;silks, emerge from the whorl of husk leaves at the end of the ear. They are often pale yellow and 18&nbsp;cm (7&nbsp;in) in length, like tufts of hair in appearance. At the end of each is a carpel, which may develop into a \"kernel\" if fertilized by a pollen grain. The&nbsp;pericarp&nbsp;of the fruit is fused with the seed coat referred to as \"caryopsis\", typical of the&nbsp;grasses, and the entire kernel is often referred to as the \"seed\". The cob is close to a&nbsp;multiple fruit&nbsp;in structure, except that the individual fruits (the kernels) never fuse into a single mass. The grains are about the size of&nbsp;peas, and adhere in regular rows around a white, pithy substance, which forms the ear. The maximum size of kernels is reputedly 2.5&nbsp;cm (1&nbsp;in).[38]&nbsp;An ear commonly holds 600 kernels. They are of various colors: blackish,&nbsp;bluish-gray,&nbsp;purple, green, red, white and yellow. When ground into&nbsp;flour, maize yields more flour with much less&nbsp;bran&nbsp;than wheat does. It lacks the protein&nbsp;gluten&nbsp;of wheat and, therefore, makes baked goods with poor rising capability. A&nbsp;genetic variant&nbsp;that accumulates more sugar and less&nbsp;starch&nbsp;in the ear is consumed as a vegetable and is called&nbsp;sweet corn. Young ears can be consumed raw, with the&nbsp;cob&nbsp;and silk, but as the plant matures (usually during the summer months), the cob becomes tougher and the silk dries to inedibility. By the end of the&nbsp;growing season, the kernels dry out and become difficult to chew without cooking them tender first in boiling water.', '16067368335fc4dbc13d6e1Zea maize.jpg'),

It is also one of the most commonly planted Atriplex species, each being generally considered as having well-defined species limits and are rarely confused taxonomically.<br />A number of varieties of A. semibaccata are reported including var. appendiculata, var. biformis, var. gracilis, var. melanocarpa and var. microcarpa (The Plant List, 2013), indicating considerable morphological variation within the species. However, CSIRO (2007) refer to two forms only in Australia, its native range, based on the fruiting bracteoles. One form has thin dry and deltoid bracteoles and is found in Queensland and New South Wales, whereas rhomboid and succulent bracteoles are found in Western Australia and southern areas. A. semibaccata is also noted to hybridize with A. spinibractea in New South Wales and this may have led to the variant with dry bracteoles in northern Queensland described as A. neurivalvis[A. semibaccata] (CSIRO, 2007).<br />A. semibaccata was one of seven species analysed for genetic variability using molecular markers (other species include A. amnicola, A. canescens, A. halimus, A. lentiformis, A. nummularia and A. undulata). Phylogenetic analysis confirmed the divergence of A. semibaccata from all other species and the closeness of A. lentiformis to A. halimus (Bouda et al., 2008). Intraspecies variability was also high and genetic diversity was greater among species (60%) than among individuals (40%) (Bouda et al., 2008).<br />The common name for this species is Australian saltbush, although it is not the only Atriplex species native to Australia.<br />There are many references especially in the USA, but also in southern Africa, to unidentified&nbsp;Atriplex&nbsp;sp.,&nbsp;Atriplex&nbsp;spp. or simply referring to &lsquo;saltbush&rsquo; which may or may not include&nbsp;A. semibaccata.&nbsp;<br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>Distribution:</strong></span><br />A. semibaccata is native to southern parts of Australia (Council of Heads of Australasian Herbaria, 2015; USDA-ARS, 2015). It is widespread in the eastern and southern Australian states, with a separate population in Western Australia and scattered occurrences in central arid areas. Its presence in Tasmania and some mainland areas for grazing in saline areas are considered to be introductions (CSIRO, 2007). Informal reference to two forms is given in the Flora of Australia based on the fruiting bracteoles (see Notes on Taxonomy and Nomenclature section).<br /><br />A. semibaccata&nbsp;is one of many&nbsp;Atriplex&nbsp;species that have been introduced around the world as a drought and salt tolerant fodder crop. It has been introduced into North America, North Africa, the Horn of Africa, the Middle East and also in parts of southern Africa, the Arabian peninsula and southern Europe.&nbsp;<br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>Uses:</strong></span><br />In Australia, its native range, A. semibaccata is planted in agroforestry combinations, for example in systems to improve performance and profitability of vineyards (Hoare, 2011). It is also planted as a cover crop where it has effects on beneficial and pest invertebrates (Danne et al., 2010). In addition, it has been planted with the aim of restoring mine spoils, e.g. on saline gold mine wastes (Osborne and Brearley, 1995). The Corto strain of A. semibaccata was assessed as a ground cover species for controlling erosion and for landscaping (Holzworth and Garrison, 1978). There are also records of A. semibaccata being used for human food (Anon, 1943).<br />In North America, where this species is introduced, A. semibaccata can provide supplementary feed in summer and winter as a component of saltland pasture, when other sources of paddock feed are less available. This species is one of the more readily grazed Atriplex saltbushes and is considered a valuable species either as a source of variety in the diet or as a major component (Florabank, 2015). However, as was noted in Cape Verde, due to the high salt content within the foliage, intake of all Atriplex species is reduced to almost zero if there is not adequate availability of drinking water for livestock (Pasiecznik et al., 1996). A. semibaccata var. corta also gave comparatively good cover and sward quality as a turfgrass alternative (Gibeault et al., 1989).<br />A. semibaccata&nbsp;is one of many halophyte species planted for land reclamation and as a fodder crop with or without saline water irrigation in the Mediterranean region (Hou&eacute;rou et al., 1995).&nbsp;A. semibaccata&nbsp;was found to be one of the best two performing species for restoring bare patches of ground in the Nama-Karoo of South Africa (Visser et al., 2007).<br />', '16067377775fc4df71db98dAtriplex semibaccata11.jpg'),

The 5-petaled flowers are 10 cm (4 in) in diameter, with prominent orange-tipped red anthers.<br />&nbsp;<br />The flowers are large, conspicuous, trumpet-shaped, with five&nbsp;petals&nbsp;and their colors can be white to pink, red, orange, peach, and yellow or purple that are 4&ndash;18&nbsp;cm broad. The flowers from various cultivars and hybrids can be either a single flower or a double flower.<br /><br />At the bottom of every hibiscus bud is the&nbsp;calyx&nbsp;which is green in color. The pointed ends of the calyx are the sepals. When the hibiscus begins to bloom, the petals begin to grow which contains multiple petals and multiple colors. The&nbsp;ovary&nbsp;and other female parts of the flower lie in the main structure of the hibiscus, the&nbsp;pistil, which is long and tubular. The hibiscus has both male and female parts on the same flower. The five hairy red spots on the top of the flower is the&nbsp;stigma&nbsp;(female part) of the flower. The stigma is located at the end of the style branch. At the top of the pistil is known as the stigma, where&nbsp;pollen&nbsp;is collected, and in the middle is the style, which is the section that the pollen travels down to the ovary. The ovary lies at the bottom of the blossom and the hibiscus has only one ovary which is superior.<br /><br />The male part (stamen) of the flower consists of stem-like filaments and each filament ends with the pollen-producing anther. The&nbsp;anthers, which release the pollen, sits on the filament and these two organs make up the stamen, the male part of the flower. Together, these organs make up the male part of the flower known as the stamen. The hibiscus has hundreds of stamens. Overall, the hibiscus is a&nbsp;dicot, with solitary (axillary), complete, perfect flowers, which have a superior ovary, regular symmetry, and axile placentation.

It is cultivated as an important&nbsp;forage&nbsp;crop in many countries around the world. It is used for&nbsp;grazing,&nbsp;hay, and&nbsp;silage, as well as a&nbsp;green manure&nbsp;and&nbsp;cover crop. The name alfalfa is used in North America. The name lucerne is the more commonly used name in the United Kingdom, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. The plant superficially resembles&nbsp;clover&nbsp;(a cousin in the same family), especially while young, when&nbsp;trifoliate&nbsp;leaves comprising round&nbsp;leaflets&nbsp;predominate. Later in maturity, leaflets are elongated. It has&nbsp;clusters&nbsp;of small purple flowers followed by fruits spiralled in 2 to 3 turns containing 10&ndash;20 seeds. Alfalfa is native to warmer&nbsp;temperate climates. It has been cultivated as&nbsp;livestock&nbsp;fodder&nbsp;since at least the era of the ancient&nbsp;Greeks&nbsp;and&nbsp;Romans. Alfalfa&nbsp;sprouts&nbsp;are a common ingredient in dishes made in&nbsp;South Indian cuisine.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>History:</strong></span><br />Alfalfa seems to have originated in south-central Asia, and was first cultivated in ancient Iran.[7][8] According to Pliny (died 79 AD), it was introduced to Greece in about 490 BC when the Persians invaded Greek territory. Alfalfa cultivation is discussed in the fourth-century AD book Opus Agriculturae by Palladius, stating: \"One sow-down lasts ten years. The crop may be cut four or six times a year ... A jugerum of it is abundantly sufficient for three horses all the year ... It may be given to cattle, but new provender is at first to be administered very sparingly, because it bloats up the cattle.\"[9] Pliny and Palladius called alfalfa in Latin medica, a name that referred to the Medes, a people who lived in ancient Iran. The ancient Greeks and Romans believed, probably correctly, that alfalfa came from the Medes\' land, in today\'s Iran. (The ancient Greeks and Romans also used the name medica to mean a citron fruit, once again because it was believed to have come from the Medes\' land). This name is the root of the modern scientific name for the alfalfa genus, Medicago.<br />The medieval Arabic agricultural writer Ibn al-\'Awwam, who lived in Spain in the later 12th century, discussed how to cultivate alfalfa, which he called Ø§Ù„ÙØµÙØµØ© (al-fiá¹£fiá¹£a).[10] A 13th-century general-purpose Arabic dictionary, LisÄn al-\'Arab, says that alfalfa is cultivated as an animal feed and consumed in both fresh and dried forms.[11] It is from the Arabic that the Spanish name alfalfa was derived.<br />In the 16th century, Spanish colonizers introduced alfalfa to the Americas as fodder for their horses.<br />In the&nbsp;North American colonies of the eastern US&nbsp;in the 18th century, it was called \"lucerne\", and many trials at growing it were made, but generally without sufficiently successful results.[8]&nbsp;Relatively little is grown in the southeastern United States today.[13]&nbsp;Lucerne (or&nbsp;luzerne) is the name for alfalfa in Britain, Australia, France, Germany, and a number of other countries. Alfalfa seeds were imported to California from Chile in the 1850s. That was the beginning of a rapid and extensive introduction of the crop over the western US States[7]&nbsp;and introduced the word \"alfalfa\" to the English language. Since North and South America now produce a large part of the world\'s output, the word \"alfalfa\" has been slowly entering other languages.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>Ecology:</strong></span><br />Alfalfa is a perennial forage legume which normally lives four to eight years, but can live more than 20 years, depending on variety and climate.[14] The plant grows to a height of up to 1 metre (3 feet 3 inches), and has a deep root system, sometimes growing to a depth of more than 15 m (49 ft) to reach groundwater. Typically the root system grows to a depth of 2&ndash;3 m (7&ndash;10 ft) depending on subsoil constraints.[14] Owing to deep root system, it helps to improve soil nitrogen fertility and protect from soil erosion.[15] This depth of root system, and perenniality of crowns that store carbohydrates as an energy reserve, make it very resilient, especially to droughts. Alfalfa is more drought-hardy than drought-tolerant and the persistence of the plant also depends on the management of the stand. It has a tetraploid genome.<br />Alfalfa is a small-seeded crop, and has a slowly growing seedling, but after several months of establishment, forms a tough \"crown\" at the top of the root system. This crown contains shoot buds that enable alfalfa to regrow many times after being grazed or harvested; however, overgrazing of the buds will reduce the new leaves on offer to the grazing animal.<br />This plant exhibits&nbsp;autotoxicity, which means it is difficult for alfalfa seed to grow in existing stands of alfalfa.[17]&nbsp;Therefore, alfalfa fields are recommended to be&nbsp;rotated&nbsp;with other species (for example,&nbsp;corn&nbsp;or wheat) before reseeding.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>Nutritional value:<br /></strong><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\">Raw alfalfa seed sprouts are 93% water, 2%&nbsp;carbohydrates, 4%&nbsp;protein, and contain negligible&nbsp;fat&nbsp;(table).
